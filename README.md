# RPG-MAKER-MV-PLUGINS
A Collection of helpful RPG Maker MV Plugins.

Plugins for RPG Maker MV only.

InBattleCheck ["BattleCheck"] - tracked by a global switch provides the ability to check if in battle using a conditional branch in events. Requires minimal setup, assign a global switch and use the plugin command ["BattleCheck"]. Why does this exist? Well, sometimes you might want a global event to trigger instead of creating multiple troop events
AnalogueStickMovement - Allows the use of one (1) analogue stick (left or right) on the gamepad for four (4) directional movement and UI controls. Does not handle anything other than the analogue stick.
RunCommonEventOnce ["RunCommonEventOnce","ResetOneTimeEvents","RunCommonEventOnBattleStart","RunCommonEventOnBattleEnd"] - A versatile plugin for running a global common event once. It can do a generic parallel or autorun launched event. Please read the guide to understand how to setup. It also allows triggering of common events at the start and end of battle.
DefaultOptions - a plugin that exposes inbuilt options settings in the plugin manager to allow for setting default options when there is no config.rpgsave file, making deployment easier and player first time experiences better.
DefaultOptionsExtension - allows you to add your own default plugin options (an API to interface with DefaultOptions)

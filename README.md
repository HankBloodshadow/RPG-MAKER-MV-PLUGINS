- **Setup:** Minimal; assign a global switch and use the plugin command `BattleCheck`.  
- **Use case:** Sometimes you want a global event to trigger instead of creating multiple troop events.

- Four-directional movement  
- UI controls  

> Note: Only handles analogue stick input. Other controls are unaffected.
